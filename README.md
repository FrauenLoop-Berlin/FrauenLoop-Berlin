FrauenLoop was created to support a technological future in which everyone contributes and no one feels marginalized, tokenized or stigmatized. We are a community of technology professionals who understand how tech defines nearly every aspect of modern life, including how we learn, work, hire, and socialize. We select and train motivated women-identified persons for professional jobs in emerging tech where their diverse perspectives can make a difference in:           

* avoiding the creation of biased hiring algorithms
* creating software test cases that consider gender
* ensuring the consideration of app functionality for global audiences
